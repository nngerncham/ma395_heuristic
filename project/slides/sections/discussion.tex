\begin{frame}{Parameters from Literature}
    In the DiskANN paper, the parameters used for a similar data set was
    \[
        M=70, C=125, S=125, \alpha=2
    \]
    In another paper that compared different ANNS algorithms, the parameters for DiskANN were:
    \[
        M=64, C=128, S=128, \alpha=1.2
    \]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{NSGA-II}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The relative spread of build time and search time are roughly the same but recall can be significantly worse without scaling
        \item Compared to BO, the values is significantly closer to the parameters that come from literature... only if you have scaling
        \item Scaling the objective functions gives better results overall
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bayesian Optimization}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\alpha\) was the only parameter whose value is pretty close to the value used in the comparison paper
        \item The rest are \textit{consistently inconsistent}
        \item From past experience running DiskANN on my machine, using higher parameter values than in the paper has yield better results
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
